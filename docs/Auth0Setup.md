# Auth0 -> k8s
Setup an Issuer via Auth0 to authenticate and authorize your k8s cluster

## Security Considerations
This tool allows for easy authentication of users for k8s. While we have followed best practices for the tool, there are still security considerations to be taken when setting up the actual pieces that handle authentication:
- we are using the PKCE flow and thus do not need to support other flows. If the authentication application supports things like the Implicit Flow you could open yourself up to potential security risks.
- if your setup issues refresh tokens you need to be aware that a refresh token allows a user to be authenticated indefinitely until the refresh token is revoked. If your setup does not issue refresh tokens there's nothing to worry about as this tool will still work and will require re-authentication any time the users access token expires.

## Auth0 Setup
1. Go to [https://manage.auth0.com/#/apis](https://manage.auth0.com/#/apis) and create an API. This will represent the Kubernetes API. For this example, name it `minikube` and give it an identifier along the same lines `minikube`. Leave the signing to be RS256.
2. Under the settings section of the newly created API scroll down to `Allow Offline Access`. Turn this option on if you wish to use Refresh Tokens. See [Security Considerations](#securityconsiderations) for more details.
3. Save the API Identifier (not to be confused with the Id) for later.
4. Go to [https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications) and create an application. This will be the application that users login to when authenticating to interact with Kubernetes. Name it something like `minikube-login` and choose `Native` as the application type. This application type is used because the [Authorization Code Grant Flow with PKCE](https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/tutorials/authorization-code-grant-pkce) is used by this tool and that flow will only work when the application type is `Native`.
5. Under the settings section of the newly created Application, add `http://localhost:8080/callback` to the `Allowed Callback URLs` section. This tool will be listening for a short period of time at that location when the user authenticates so it can handle receiving the needed information from Auth0.
6. Scroll down to the bottom of the application settings, click on `Show Advanced Settings`, and click on `Grant Types`. Make sure to uncheck `Implicit` as the tool does not use that Grant Type and leaving it on could allow for flows different from PKCE. If you don't want to use refresh tokens make sure you uncheck the `Refresh Token` Grant Type. See [Security Considerations](#securityconsiderations) for more details.
7. Go to [https://manage.auth0.com/#/extensions](https://manage.auth0.com/#/extensions) and find and install the `Auth0 Authorization Extension`. This will allow you to set up the groups and assign users to them.
8. For this example, create two groups: `cluster-view` and `cluster-admin`. Assign them to your users.
9. In the upper right hand corner, select your username and click `Configuration` and then scroll down to `Persistance`.
10. Make sure the `Groups` slider is set to yes so the users groups will be stored in their profile. Scroll up and click `Publish Rule` so the information is store in their profiles.
11. Open up [Auth0 Rules](https://manage.auth0.com/#/rules) and create a new empty rule.
12. Name the rule `add groups to token for minikube-login` and set the contents of the rule to:
```javascript
function (user, context, callback) {
  const namespace = 'http://minikube';
  if (context.clientID === "<CLIENT ID>") {
    if (user.app_metadata !== undefined && 
        user.app_metadata.authorization !== undefined &&
        user.app_metadata.authorization.groups !== undefined) {
      context.accessToken[`${namespace}/groups`] = user.app_metadata.authorization.groups;
    }
    context.accessToken[`${namespace}/email`] = user.email;
  }
  return callback(null, user, context);
}
```
13. Make sure you've put in the client ID you saved from step 5 and save the rule. This rule is what adds the group a user was added to via the Authorization Extension to their access token. We will only add these groups to their token when they are authenticating against your `minikube-login` application.


## Kubernetes Setup
Kubernetes needs to be configured to validate tokens sent to it and also pull group information so it can apply roles. The settings for this are configured on the API server: 
```bash
--authorization-mode=RBAC \
--oidc-issuer-url="https://joncarl.auth0.com/" \
--oidc-client-id=minikube \
--oidc-username-claim=http://minikube/email \
--oidc-groups-claim=http://minikube/groups \
--oidc-groups-prefix=minikube-
```

- `authorization-mode` - this needs to be set to `RBAC` so that Kubernetes uses roles to provide authorization
- `oidc-issuer-url` - this should be the URL of your Auth0 domain
- `oidc-client-id` - the API client ID from step 3 of the Auth0 configuration. Do not confuse this with the application client ID. This id is what we refer to as the audience when you init k8s-pixy-auth.
- `oidc-username-claim` - the token claim that the username will be pulled from. this must be set the claim the email is added to in the rule
- `oidc-groups-claim` - the token claim that the users groups will be pulled from.
- `oidc-groups-prefix` - the prefix that Kubernetes will add to each role from the token before matching it to a role in Kubernetes


For minikube this can be configured as follows:
```bash
minikube start --extra-config=apiserver.authorization-mode=RBAC \
--extra-config=apiserver.oidc-issuer-url="https://joncarl.auth0.com/" \
--extra-config=apiserver.oidc-client-id=minikube \
--extra-config=apiserver.oidc-username-claim=http://minikube/email \
--extra-config=apiserver.oidc-groups-claim=http://minikube/groups \
--extra-config=apiserver.oidc-groups-prefix=minikube-
```


TODO: use namespaces groups and email with rule!!!

The next step is to create groups. For this example we already have two groups on the Auth0 side: `cluster-admin` and `cluster-view`. To make these groups in Kubernetes, run the following:
- `kubectl create clusterrolebinding platform-cluster-view --clusterrole=view --group=platform-cluster-view`
- `kubectl create clusterrolebinding platform-cluster-admin --clusterrole=cluster-admin --group=platform-cluster-admin`
Note that we added `minikube-` to the beginning of the `--group`. As mentioned above, Kubernetes will automatically prepend `minikube-` to the group name from the token (`cluster-admin` becomes `minikube-cluster-admin`) and then matches that group against the groups already in Kubernetes.

## Kube Config Setup
Now that we have the Auth0 and Kubernetes pieces set up, lets setup your Kube config. k8s-pixy-auth makes it really easy to get things set up with one command. Run the following and make sure your add in the variables you need instead of the example ones: `k8s-pixy-auth init --context-name "minikube" --issuer-endpoint "https://joncarl.auth0.com" --audience "minikube" --client-id "QXV0aDAgaXMgaGlyaW5nISBhdXRoMC5jb20vY2FyZWVycyAK"`. If you want to see what happened in your kube config you should find that the context you passed into the init command has a new user aith `-exec-auth` on the end. If you find the user in the file is should be setup similar to the following:
```yaml
- name: minikube-exec-auth
  user:
    exec:
      apiVersion: client.authentication.k8s.io/v1beta1
      args:
      - auth
      - --issuer-endpoint=https://joncarl.auth0.com
      - --client-id=QXV0aDAgaXMgaGlyaW5nISBhdXRoMC5jb20vY2FyZWVycyAK
      - --audience=minikube
      command: /Users/joncarl/.k8s-pixy-auth/bin/k8s-pixy-auth
```

- `user.exec.command` is the pointing to the binary
- `user.exec.args` are the different args passed into the binary 

You're all set! Run any command against kubernetes and it will open your browser for you to authenticate and then use that token to identify you when talking to Kubernetes. Your tokens are stored locally, so once you initially authenticate it will store a refresh token to get new credentials whenever your tokens expire. If you need to clear out saved tokens, simply remove the config file located at `~/.k8s-pixy-auth/config`.
